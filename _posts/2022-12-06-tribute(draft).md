Let me begin 

Dear grandma,   

I am writing to reach you—even if each word I put down is one word further from where you are  

This is the beginning sentence of my favorite book  
And I always long for writing it to someone I love so deeply  
But not able to truly approach through words  
We don't share a common language, except for the I love yous that we never say to each other  
You put them into all the meals that you cooked for us  
I put them into the hugs that I gave you  

I am writing to you  
And I hope I am writing more like a poet  

You were so  
Energetic
Lively and, loud sometimes  
That I almost forgot that you existed before   

It seems like centuries, that I encounter such a kind of you  
It’s been lost  
And will be long lost, since you are nowhere to be found now  
You were stolen away  
By time  

But I know you’re in the wind  
You hide into the moonlight  
And when I gaze afar  
You are right in the scenery that I gaze into  

when I think of you  
You could be at anywhere  

Auntie said she hated me for recording this clip  
Because you’re working  
We made you physically exhausted, sacrificed and we never fully express our gratitude  

Mom said, you birthday changed now  
It is coming earlier this year  
There might be one year, that mom outlives you, and I outlive you too  
So will Auntie, and Meimei  
You will become the youngest among five of us
